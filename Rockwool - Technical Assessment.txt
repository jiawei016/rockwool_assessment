Project Brief
Your assignment is to design and develop a single-page application with React as frontend and .Net 6/8, C# as backend for a news blog. The core functionality of the application should include:

Frontend - React v18
•	A search bar for users to enter a news title
•	A button to execute the search
•	A list table to display the search results, which should consist of three news records per page and the list support pagination.
•	Execute an API call to .Net backend API and fetch data asynchronously.
•	Limiting the display text (30 characters) of the news title on the list table, ending with '...'
•	A popup that displays the full news article when a news item is clicked

Backend - .Net 6/8, C#
•	Create the .Net C# backend web api to call third party API (https://newsdata.io). 
•	You will need to create a free account (limited to 200 calls per day) here: https://newsdata.io/search-news. Use the API key from your account, and fill up the parameter 'languague=en' and 'q' with the value pass from the frontend's search bar.
•	Please refer https://newsdata.io/documentation for more information.
•	Return the data from third party API to frontend in JSON format.
